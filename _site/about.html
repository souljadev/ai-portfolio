  <main><h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>Product Manager with an engineering foundation and a proven track record of building large-scale merchant integrations, launching API-first developer platforms, and leading cross-functional initiatives that drive measurable business outcomes. At Grubhub, I scaled enterprise integrations with brands like Starbucks and Chipotle and launched the public developer portal, enabling partners to self-serve and accelerating onboarding efficiency. Beyond marketplace and payments, I’ve built AI-driven projects and developer-facing tools that bridge technical depth with business impact, drawing on domain expertise across restaurant tech, fintech, and real estate. Passionate about building platforms that empower developers, unlock growth, and deliver value at scale.</p>

<p><strong>Focus</strong>: Practical AI that improves ops, revenue, and developer experience.</p>
